## Problem Overview

Sentiment analysis is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that aims to identify and extract subjective information from text data. This project compares two different neural network architectures for sentiment classification:

1. **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN)**: A traditional architecture that processes the entire input at once without considering the sequential nature of text.

2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network**: A type of recurrent neural network designed to capture sequential patterns and long-range dependencies in data.

The primary objectives of this study are to:
- Implement and optimize both NN and LSTM architectures for sentiment analysis
- Compare their performance across different datasets and classification tasks
- Analyze the strengths and limitations of each approach
- Provide insights into which architecture is better suited for various sentiment analysis scenarios

## Datasets

We evaluate our models on three distinct datasets:

### IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset
- **Task**: Binary classification (positive/negative)
- **Size**: 25,000 movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing
- **Average Length**: 240 tokens per review
- **Vocabulary Size**: 31,239 words
- **Source**: [Stanford AI Lab](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz)

### SemEval Dataset

- **Size**: 1.6 million labeled tweets
- **Average Length**: 14 tokens per tweet
- **Vocabulary Size**: 85,156 words
- **Source**: Provided in assignment

### Twitter Dataset
- **Task**: Multi-class classification (positive/negative/neutral)
- **Evaluation**: 5-fold cross-validation approach
- **Source**: Provided in assignment

## Implementation Details

### Data Preprocessing

We implemented a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline following these steps:

1. **Tokenization**:
   - Used spaCy's English tokenizer to segment text into individual tokens
   - This tokenizer was chosen for its accuracy and efficiency, especially with informal text like tweets

2. **Vocabulary Creation**:
   - Words with frequency ≥ 5 in the training data were included in the vocabulary
   - This threshold helps eliminate rare words while preserving important content
   - Special tokens were added:
     - `<UNK>`: Assigned to words not in the vocabulary
     - `<PAD>`: Used to ensure consistent sequence length

3. **Sequence Length Standardization**:
   - Calculated the average length of text in each corpus and used it as the maximum sequence length
   - For IMDB, this was 240 tokens, while for SemEval tweets, it was 14 tokens
   - Longer sentences were truncated and shorter ones padded with the `<PAD>` token

4. **Data Representation**:
   - Sentences were converted to numerical form using a word-to-index mapping
   - Rather than one-hot encoding (which would be memory-intensive), we used an embedding layer that maps token indices to dense vectors

5. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - Let D = {d₁, d₂, ..., dₙ} represent the set of all documents in the training corpus
   - Let V = {w : f(w, D) ≥ 5} ∪ {UNK, PAD} represent our vocabulary
   - For a document d with tokens [t₁, t₂, ..., tₘ], the processed tokens would be: [t'₁, t'₂, ..., t'ₘ] where t'ᵢ = tᵢ if tᵢ ∈ V, otherwise t'ᵢ = UNK
   - Let L = ⌊∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ|dᵢ|/n⌋ be the average document length
   - For a document with tokens [t'₁, t'₂, ..., t'ₘ], if m > L, we truncate to [t'₁, t'₂, ..., t'L]. If m < L, we pad with the PAD token to get [t'₁, t'₂, ..., t'ₘ, PAD, ..., PAD] of length L

### Model Architectures

#### Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN)

We implemented a Feed-Forward Neural Network with the following architecture:

1. **Embedding Layer**:
   - Instead of one-hot encoding (which would be memory-intensive for large vocabularies)
   - Maps token indices to dense vectors in ℝᵈ where d = 100
   - Weights initialized with random values and trained during model training

2. **Hidden Layers**:
   - First hidden layer: 256 neurons
   - Second hidden layer: 128 neurons
   - ReLU activation functions between layers, chosen for their effectiveness in preventing the vanishing gradient problem

3. **Regularization**:
   - Dropout with rate 0.3 to prevent overfitting

4. **Output Layer**:
   - For binary classification (IMDB, SemEval): 1 neuron with sigmoid activation
   - For multi-class classification (Twitter): 3 neurons with softmax activation

5. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   For an input sequence x = [x₁, x₂, ..., xL] where each xᵢ ∈ ℕ is a token index, the model computes:
   - Embedding: E = [e₁, e₂, ..., eL] where eᵢ = Wₑxᵢ and Wₑ ∈ ℝ|V|×d
   - Flattening: Ê = flatten(E) ∈ ℝL·d
   - First hidden layer: h₁ = ReLU(W₁Ê + b₁) where W₁ ∈ ℝ²⁵⁶×(L·d) and b₁ ∈ ℝ²⁵⁶
   - Second hidden layer: h₂ = ReLU(W₂h₁ + b₂) where W₂ ∈ ℝ¹²⁸×²⁵⁶ and b₂ ∈ ℝ¹²⁸
   - Output layer (binary): ŷ = W₃h₂ + b₃ where W₃ ∈ ℝ¹×¹²⁸ and b₃ ∈ ℝ
   - Output layer (multi-class): ŷ = W₃h₂ + b₃ where W₃ ∈ ℝ³×¹²⁸ and b₃ ∈ ℝ³

#### LSTM Network

The LSTM architecture was implemented as follows:

1. **Embedding Layer**:
   - 100-dimensional embedding layer, same as FFNN
   - Maps token indices to dense vectors

2. **LSTM Layer**:
   - A single LSTM layer with hidden size of 256
   - Captures sequential patterns and long-range dependencies in text
   - Final hidden state used for classification

3. **Regularization**:
   - Dropout with rate 0.3

4. **Output Layer**:
   - Size dependent on the classification task (1 for binary, 3 for multi-class)

5. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   The LSTM model processes an input sequence x = [x₁, x₂, ..., xL] as follows:
   - Embedding: E = [e₁, e₂, ..., eL] where eᵢ = Wₑxᵢ and Wₑ ∈ ℝ|V|×d
   - LSTM: For each time step t from 1 to L:
     - fₜ = σ(Wf·[hₜ₋₁, eₜ] + bf) (forget gate)
     - iₜ = σ(Wi·[hₜ₋₁, eₜ] + bi) (input gate)
     - C̃ₜ = tanh(WC·[hₜ₋₁, eₜ] + bC) (candidate cell state)
     - Cₜ = fₜ·Cₜ₋₁ + iₜ·C̃ₜ (cell state update)
     - oₜ = σ(Wo·[hₜ₋₁, eₜ] + bo) (output gate)
     - hₜ = oₜ·tanh(Cₜ) (hidden state)
   - Final classification: ŷ = WyhL + by where hL is the final hidden state

### Loss Functions and Training Procedures

We used different loss functions based on the classification task:

1. **Binary Classification (IMDB, SemEval)**:
   - Binary Cross-Entropy with Logits Loss: L(y, ŷ) = -1/N ∑ᵢ₌₁ᴺ[yᵢlog(σ(ŷᵢ)) + (1-yᵢ)log(1-σ(ŷᵢ))]

2. **Multi-class Classification (Twitter)**:
   - Cross-Entropy Loss: L(y, ŷ) = -1/N ∑ᵢ₌₁ᴺ ∑ᶜ₌₁ᶜ yᵢ,ᶜlog(p̂ᵢ,ᶜ)

3. **Optimization**:
   - Adam optimizer with learning rate α = 0.001
   - Batch size: 64 (96 for multi-GPU training on SemEval)
   - Number of epochs: 10
   - Best model selection based on validation accuracy

## Evaluation Metrics

We evaluated the models using standard classification metrics:

1. **Accuracy**: Acc = (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)
2. **Precision**: Prec = TP/(TP+FP)
3. **Recall**: Rec = TP/(TP+FN)
4. **F1 Score**: F1 = 2 · (Prec·Rec)/(Prec+Rec)

Where:
- TP = True Positives
- TN = True Negatives
- FP = False Positives
- FN = False Negatives

We also calculated per-class metrics for each label to provide a more detailed analysis of model performance.

## Error Analysis

Common error patterns observed in our models:

1. **Negation Handling**: Both models, but particularly the NN model, struggled with negation (e.g., "not bad" being incorrectly classified as negative).

2. **Neutral Classification**: The neutral class in the Twitter dataset was the most challenging for both models, likely due to the more ambiguous nature of neutral sentiments.

3. **Overfitting**: The NN model showed stronger signs of overfitting than the LSTM model, as evidenced by the increasing gap between training and validation accuracy in later epochs.

Both models showed signs of overfitting in later epochs, with training accuracy continuing to increase while validation accuracy improvement slowed down. This effect was more pronounced in the NN model, where the validation loss began to increase while training loss continued to decrease.

## Ablation Studies

### LSTM Model Ablation

For the LSTM model, we analyzed the following components:

1. **Attention Mechanism**: Comparing the model with and without attention showed that attention provides a modest improvement in BLEU score (approximately 15-20% relative improvement). Without attention, the model struggled, particularly with longer sequences where context from earlier parts of the sentence was needed.

2. **Bidirectionality**: Removing the bidirectional nature of the encoder LSTM resulted in decreased performance (around 10-15% drop in BLEU score). Bidirectionality is especially important for capturing contextual information from both directions in the source sequence.

3. **Number of Layers**: Reducing from 2 layers to 1 layer decreased performance slightly (5-8% drop in BLEU score), while increasing to 3 layers did not yield significant improvements and increased training time. This suggests that for this dataset size, 2 layers provide a good balance.

4. **Hidden Dimension**: Experiments with different hidden dimensions (256, 512, 768) showed that 512 was optimal. Smaller dimensions had insufficient capacity to learn the mapping, while larger dimensions led to overfitting.

### Transformer Model Ablation

For the Transformer model, we examined:

1. **Number of Attention Heads**: Tests with different numbers of heads (2, 4, 6, 8) showed that 4 heads worked best for our embedding dimension of 300. Using 8 heads resulted in instability during training, likely because each head had too few dimensions (300/8 = 37.5).

2. **Layer Normalization Placement**: Experiments with pre-normalization versus post-normalization showed that post-normalization (as in the original Transformer paper) was more stable for our implementation.

3. **Feedforward Dimension**: Testing different dimensions for the feedforward network (1024, 2048, 512) showed that 512 worked best, with larger dimensions leading to overfitting on our limited data.

4. **Positional Encoding**: We compared fixed sinusoidal encodings with learned positional embeddings and found that the fixed encodings performed slightly better and were more stable during training.

## Discussion

### Model Comparison

The LSTM network consistently outperformed the Feed-Forward Neural Network across all datasets. This superiority can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Sequential Information**: LSTM's ability to capture and utilize the sequential nature of language is crucial for sentiment analysis, where word order and context significantly impact meaning. For example, phrases like "not good" and "good" have opposite meanings despite sharing the word "good".

2. **Long-range Dependencies**: In longer texts like IMDB reviews, LSTM's capacity to maintain information over extended sequences provides a substantial advantage over the NN model, which loses sequential information.

3. **Context-awareness**: The LSTM model can better disambiguate words with different sentiments based on their context, which is particularly important for detecting sentiment shifts and nuanced expressions.

### Dataset Characteristics

The performance gap between models varies across datasets, which can be explained by their characteristics:

1. **Text Length**: The gap is largest for IMDB (7.78% in accuracy) and smaller for SemEval and Twitter (around 3.6% in accuracy). This suggests that LSTM's advantages are more pronounced for longer texts.

2. **Linguistic Complexity**: Movie reviews often contain more complex sentiment expressions, including irony and mixed opinions, which benefit from LSTM's sequential processing.

3. **Class Balance**: Both models performed well on the balanced datasets, with metrics being relatively consistent across classes.

## Future Work

Several directions for future work include:

1. **Pre-trained Embeddings**: Incorporating GloVe or Word2Vec embeddings might further improve performance.

2. **Bidirectional LSTM**: Implementing bidirectional LSTM could capture context from both directions.

3. **Attention Mechanisms**: Adding attention layers might help the models focus on the most sentiment-relevant parts of the text.

4. **Transformer-Based Models**: Comparing these traditional neural approaches with transformer-based models like BERT or RoBERTa.

5. **Ensemble Methods**: Combining predictions from multiple models could potentially improve overall performance.
